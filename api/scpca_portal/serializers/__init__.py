"""The serializers included in this directory can be used for nested relationships.

These serializers do not use nested relationships themselves, so that
if a sample object links to a computed file and the computed file
links to the sample, the JSON won't recur infinitely. For any
relationships, these serializers will use PrimaryKeyRelatedFields or
SlugRelatedFields.

The one exception is the ProjectSerializer because it will always include its summaries.
